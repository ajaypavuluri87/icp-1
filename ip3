1.Nested Interactive loop:
L1 = []
n = int(input("Enter the number of customers: ")) # this line is written to
read the input from the user
for i in range(n):
 height = float(input(f"Enter height for customer {i+1} in inches: "))
 L1.append(height)
 # The below i have used a nested loop to convert the
heights to centimeters
L2 = []
for height in L1:
 cm = height * 2.54 # the value 2.54 used for the conversion
 L2.append(round(cm, 2))
 # The below line prints the output
print("Heights in centimeters:", L2)
Result:
Enter the number of customers: 4
Enter height for customer 1 in inches: 150
Enter height for customer 2 in inches: 155
Enter height for customer 3 in inches: 145
Enter height for customer 4 in inches: 148
Heights in centimeters: [381.0, 393.7, 368.3, 375.92]
2.List Comprehension:
# the below line reads the heights inputs in inches from the user
n = int(input(" enter the No customers "))
L1 = [float(input(f"Enter the height of customer {i+1} in inches: ")) for i
in range(n)]
# Convert heights to centimeters using list comprehension
L2 = [round(height * 2.54, 2) for height in L1] # this line converts the
heights to centimeters by using the list comprehesion
# The below line is used to print the converted values
print("Heights in CM's:", L2)
Result:
enter the No customers: 4
Enter the height of customer 1 in inches: 150
Enter the height of customer 2 in inches: 155
Enter the height of customer 3 in inches: 145
Enter the height of customer 4 in inches: 148
Heights in CM's: [381.0, 393.7, 368.3, 375.92]
